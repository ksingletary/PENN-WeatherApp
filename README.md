## Coding Exercise – PENN Entertainment

Thank you for choosing to be a part of the PENN Entertainment Inc. interview for our Front-
End Engineering Position. For the pre-screening of this position, we are asking you

Complete a react app that will display the weather information to a user. Please provide
public Github or Git repository to review code.

## Weather Tool Coding Exercise

[Final Site Here](https://penn-weatherapp.netlify.app/)

## Technical Stack:
    • Frontend: React (functional components preferred, but class components are
    acceptable too).
    • State Management: Please use react hooks to manage state across the app.
    • API: Choose a weather API (free tier should suGice for this exercise).
    • Styling: CSS or CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.
    • Figma: A figma design may be sent to you as part of this exercise. Please use the
    referenced design for implementation.
    
## General Guidance:
    1. API Integration:
        o Fetch weather data from your chosen API when the user submits the form.
        o Handle diGerent API responses (success and error cases).
        o Update the state with the fetched data.
    2. Error Handling:
        o Display meaningful error messages if the city is not found or if there's an API
        error.
        o Allow users to retry fetching data after an error occurs.
    3. Styling:
        o Apply basic styling to ensure the UI is user-friendly and responsive.
        o Use CSS or a CSS framework to enhance the appearance of your
        components such as Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS as indicated above.
        o Ensure that the app is web accessible to the best of your ability.
        o In addition, this app should be designed with touch capabilities in mind as
        this could potentially be on an iPad or kiosk device.

    4. Unit Testing: Write basic unit tests for your components using Jest and React
    Testing Library.

## Bonus
    • Geolocation: Implement geolocation to fetch weather data based on the user's
    current location.
    • Forecast: Extend the app to display a weather forecast for the next few days.
